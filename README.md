# Nahor-Aramean Source Catalog

## Project Purpose
This repository hosts a collaborative, version-controlled catalog of primary textual and archaeological evidence related to the figure of Nahor, his descendants, and the development of their associated cultic practices among Aramean tribes. The catalog aims to provide a reliable, peer‑reviewed dataset for future research on ancient Near Eastern history, with a focus on the cultures and societies of Mesopotamia and the Levant from the Early Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age.

## Scope
- **Chronological range:** Early Bronze Age to Early Iron Age (ca. 3000–1000 BCE).
- **Geographical focus:** Mesopotamia, the Levant, and regions inhabited by Aramean tribes.
- **Source types:** Cuneiform tablets, stelae, ostraca, manuscripts, and other relevant archaeological finds.
- **Key figures:** Nahor (son of Terah), his descendants, and the tribal groupings associated with them.
